1. install 2014-05-05 wheezy
2. standard setup ensuring SPI is on
3. sudo apt-get update
4. sudo apt-get upgrade
5. git clone https://github.com/robingreig/raspi-git
6. git config --global user.name "Robin Greig"
7. git config --global user.email "robin.greig@calalta.com"
8. sudo apt-get install autossh wiringpi python3-rpi.gpio python-mysqldb python3-spidev
9. To confirm spi is enabled via raspi-config:
	> lsmod | grep -i spi should show spi_bcm2835 or spi_bcm2807
	> ls -l /dev/spi* should show /dev/spi0.0 & /dev/spi0.1
10. To troubleshoot, cd /tmp
	> git clone https://github.com/rm-hull/spidev-test
	> cd spidev-test
	> gcc spidev_test.c -o spidev_test
	> connect MISO & MOSI together and both should be the same
		what is transmitted is also received if all is OK 	
	> run with command ./spidev_test -v
		If received data is all zero, then pins may not be connected?
	> ./spidev_test -? will show all available options
11. Hooking up the MCP3008
	> Pins 1-8 are inputs 0 - 7 and should all be tied high?
	> Pin 9, DGND is the digital ground pin for the chip.
	> Pin 10, CS is the chip select connected to GPIO8, Pin 24, CE0 of Raspi.
	> Pin 11, DIN is the data in from the Raspi, GPIO10, Pin 19, MOSI
	> Pin 12, DOUT is the data out pin, connected toGPIO9, Pin 21, MISO
	> Pin 13, CLK is the clock pin, connected to GPIO11, Pin 23, SCLK
	> Pin 14, AGND is the analog ground and connects to ground with pin 9
	> Pin 15, VREF is the analog reference voltage.
		 You can change this if you want to change the scale.
		 You probably want to keep it the same so keep this as 3v3.
	> Pin 16, VDD is the positive power pin for the chip 3v3, tied with Pin 15
12. run /home/robin/raspi-git/spidev/mcp3008Test02.py to show voltages on each pin
