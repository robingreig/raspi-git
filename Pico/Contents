C has software for ADC for battery charger, etc

C/serial01 first try
C/serial02 second try
C/serial03 A & B preset numbers & C is ADC input
C/serial04 works with all 3 analogue inputs
C/serial05 will be GPIO output if ADC voltage falls below a preset level based on serial03
> 2022.07.30 - serial05.py has error cannot covert string to float

C/serial06 will be GPIO output if ADC voltage falls and on board LED pin based on serial05
> 2022.07.30 - Need to adjust program so that LED output monitors continuously and will
not wait for serial input to do so. I still want serial input so that I can remotely poll the 
voltage of the ADC. Learned about puts command, puts variable date to stdout. Played with strcmp command
and added strcmp(buffer, "B") == 0
