2) lsmod | grep dbv will show the driversdvb_usb_rtl28xxu       28672  1
dvb_usb_v2             24576  1 dvb_usb_rtl28xxu

3) We need to blacklist those drivers
> sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dvb.conf (new file)
> add blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
> save & close the file

4) Install the correct drivers
> sudo apt install rtl-sdr

5) ensure the unit is hooked up with an antenna and run rtl_test to see if we hear anythin
> however I received this error
Found 1 device(s):
  0:  ,  , SN: ���	

Using device 0: Generic RTL2832U OEM
usb_open error -3
Please fix the device permissions, e.g. by installing the udev rules file rtl-sdr.rules
Failed to open rtlsdr device #0.

> when I googled the error it looked like I may not have the correct udev rules for the rtl-sdr?
> However when I rebooted the Pi, rtl_test it found the device and looks like it set it up properly.

6) sudo apt install gqrx-sdr and it appeared to go well, however I couldn't tune below 26MHz,
even tho the dongle will go down to 100KHz

7) Try #2, installed 64 bit Raspbian on the SD card

8) sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

9) sudo apt install gqrx-sdr
> I used "Add Remove Software" in the GUI and it shows gqrx-sdr-2.15.9-1+b2(64-bit)

10) ran lsusb and it showed the dvb driver beside the rtl dongle
> rebooted the Pi and ran it again still showed dvb driver
> rtl_test command wasn't recognized

11) sudo apt install rtl-sdr and installed with an error
> sudo apt install --fix-broken didn't look like it helped
> rebooted the Pi and ran rtl_test again and it appears to be working fine?

12) started GQRX using headphones and it appears to be working 95.9 noisy, but cannot tune below 24MHz

I/Q Input
Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5 SN: 0000001 and device string rtl=0 and input rate 1800000, no Decimationcann

13) ran lsmod and dongle still showed dvb driver
> ran lsmod | grep dvb and still appeared to show the drivers installed

14) sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dvb.conf
> added the line blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
> rebooted Pi

15) lsmod | grep dvb now doesn't return anything

16) Followed ragone.dev/post/install-sdrpp-server-raspberry-pi
> installed dependencies
> installed sdr++ server

17) installed rtaudio from fussthepiguy.tech/rtaudio-raspberry

18) following https://radiosrs.net/installing_SDRPlusPlus.html
> error on the cmake
codec2 not found
> sudo apt install codec2

19) Finally found great install instructions at 
https://www.aaronrombaut.com/build-sdr-on-raspberry-pi-5/
And to install rtl-sdr
