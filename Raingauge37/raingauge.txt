> raingauge03.py to read the toggles from the raingauge and store it in the sqlite3 database in my home directory

> raincoount01.py queries the sqlite3 database and counts the number of toggles per day and store that count in raincount.txt

> rainpub01.py takes the count * 0.245 and publishes it to mqtt topic Weather/Raingauge on mqtt21

* Had to sudo apt install mosquitto-clients -y
* and pip3 install paho-mqtt
