Pi2 = avrdude 6.1 & changed /etc/avrdude.conf to open linuxgpio
	reset = 8
	sck = 11
	MOSI = 10
	MISO = 9

*** That way the Pi2 works with both the ICSP plug as well as Gertduino board
*** But Gertduino boards don't reset after uploading code.... unless you reboot raspi

*** I got a error saying pin 8 was busy after updating /etc/avrdude.conf
1) So I ran Drogon_batch
2) I copied the avrdude & avrdude.conf back and chmod so I was running 6.1
3) then rebooted and it seems to be working ok now?
