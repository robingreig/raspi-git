Once AP is setup and mosquitto mqtt broker installed
I needed to modify the /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf file


Without listeners connection was refused
listener 1883

Without anonymous, connection wasn't authenticated
allow_anonymous true


To check the status of the mosquitto broker
sudo systemctl status mosquitto

To restart the service after modifying the .conf file
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto


To add more users or change an existing passwork
sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd name
