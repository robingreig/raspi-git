4) ran node-red from desktop and received the following message,
	along with an error message about the pallette nodes not loading
	because npm is not installed


    npm is not installed, it is recommended       
    to install the latest by running:             
        update-nodejs-and-nodered                 
                                                  
 
Start Node-RED
 
Once Node-RED has started, point a browser at http://192.168.200.23:1880
On Pi Node-RED works better with the Firefox or Chrome browser
 
Use   node-red-stop                          to stop Node-RED
Use   node-red-start                         to start Node-RED again
Use   node-red-log                           to view the recent log output
Use   sudo systemctl enable nodered.service  to autostart Node-RED at every boot
Use   sudo systemctl disable nodered.service to disable autostart on boot
 
To find more nodes and example flows - go to http://flows.nodered.org

5) ran sudo update-nodejs-and-nodered, which also installed npm
6) sudo reboot
7) started node-red as a service with sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
