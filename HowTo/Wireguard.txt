- Worked great in pivpn and using the qr code on my phone
- Made a second .conf file in pivpn for Breadboard40 and then had to copy it over
- Once I installed it on Breadboard40, i had difficulty starting it with the conf file
XXX sudo wg setconf wg0 ./configs/Breadboard40.conf
- Until I googled further and saw reference to wp-quick command
sudo wg-quick up ./configs/Breadboard40.conf
sudo wg-quick down ./configs/Breadboard40.conf 

Fresh install on Breadboard40 had an error with wg-quick up
/usr/bin/wg-quick: line 32: resolvconf: connamd not found
Had to install sudo apt install openresolv
And then it worked fine
