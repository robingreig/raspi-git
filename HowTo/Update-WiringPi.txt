Just a quick post to let you know that you’ll need a new wiringPi for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

To upgrade:

cd /tmp
wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb

Check with:

gpio -v
and make sure it’s version 2.52. I’ll push the updated sources shortly.

It will hopefully be part of the official release soon, but for now this will do.
