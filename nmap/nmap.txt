To run Tcpdump:
sudo tcpdump host 192.168.200.20 -w ~/scan_results/syn_scan/packets

To run Tcpdump in the background:
Ctrl-Z to stop it
bg

To run a full scan:
sudo nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T4 -vv --reason -oN ~/scan_results/syn_scan/nmap.results 192.168.200.20

-sS: This starts a SYN scan. 
This is technically the default scan that nmap will perform if no scan type is given, but we will include it here to be explicit.

-Pn: This tells nmap to skip the host discovery step, 
which would abort the test early if the host doesn't respond to a ping. Since we know that the target is online, we can skip this.

-p-: By default, SYN scans will only try the 1000 most commonly used ports. 
This tells nmap to check every available port.

-T4: This sets a timing profile for nmap, telling it to speed up the test at the risk of slightly less accurate results. 
0 is the slowest and 5 is the fastest. Since we're scanning every port, 
we can use this as our baseline and re-check any ports later that might have been reported incorrectly.

-vv: This increases the verbosity of the output.

--reason: This tells nmap to provide the reason that a port's state was reported a certain way.

-oN: This writes the results to a file that we can use for later analysis.

### Takes anywhere between 1/2 - 1 hour

Once it is done run:
fg to bring Tcpdump back into the foreground
Ctrl-C to terminate the process

cat ~/scan_results/syn_scan/nmap.results

To see everything from Tcpdump:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r ~/scan_results/syn_scan/packets | less

To see just SYN packet responses:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r ~/scan_results/syn_scan/packets 'src target_ip_addr and tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-syn != 0' | less

To see just traffic sent to the target:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r ~/scan_results/syn_scan/packets 'dst target_ip_addr' | less

To see just traffic sent from the target:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r ~/scan_results/syn_scan/packets 'src target_ip_addr' | less
