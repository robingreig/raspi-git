> Still intermittent
> Wondering if we need to connect with the broker ever time we
publish, so I added the client.connect(broker_address) before
every publish and it seems to be working OK
> Then I read in steves internet guide about a keepalive option
for the connect method?
> Keepalive is only the time period for the pings
> So I kept reading and read about the loop() function.
> I updated battmon24pub05.py to battmon24pub06.py
     > using the loop funtion
     > mqtt37.local rather than ip address
     > changed back to qos = 2 and seems to be working OK
