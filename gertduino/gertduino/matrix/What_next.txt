The next step is that you could merge the two program.
Thus you make a program which reads the patterns from a text
file and immediately displays them.

From there you can change the text file format.
e.g. you can add commands for loops, inverted patterns
reverse patterns etc.

In fact you have then writen a small language interpreter

Have fun
