1) Was upgrading 32GB SD card and it stopped at Wolfram-Engine. Looking back I'm thinking the piHole lockup could have 
caused a issue with downloading the update? Once I did a hard reboot the desktop wouldn't come backa and when I ran
df-h the SD card was full
2) Took a 64GB SD card and installed bookworm 64bit 2024-03-15
