*** Having to relearn much of this since I haven't used it in quite awhile and I don't recall the Arduino Program used

1) Use nano to modify the .ino file

2) Use arduino-mk to create new .hex file
2.1) Run make ..not.. make upload

3) To run avrdude:
3.1) Run from the main directory: avrdude -p atmega328p -c gpio -v -U flash:w:./build-uno/BatteryMonitor.hex:i
